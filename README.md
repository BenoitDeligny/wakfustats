TODO:
- Apply multi accounting on heals and shields
- Analyze all possible interactions in Dungeons ("cocons en sabléo" that auto take damages, ...)
- Toggle that shows the statistics details of the character (by spells)
- Toggle friendly fire
- Graph's colors by character, not position

  LOVE:
- Fix lastSpellCaster
- Refactor the multi accounting check
- Refactoring duplicated code
- Add more tests

Known issues:
- Sadida's poisons (and DoTs / HoTs in general) could be badly compute sometimes (combining with Xelor big turns)
- For now, impossible to compute Feca's glyphs damages / heals / Shields.
- A lot of spells effects are not taken into account (like Steamer's "Modérateur d'énergie")
